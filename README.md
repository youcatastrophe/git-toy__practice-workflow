# Toy - Git

## Practice Workflow

Use this application to work through some repetitive practice of the Git Workflow.

There are two phases to this project, which must be completed in order.

### Phase 1

Begin by forking this repository, as always.

Then, **from your copy on GitHub**, create one separate Issue for each item below:

- Who is your favorite entertainer (comedian, musician, actor, etc.)?
- What is something that is popular now that annoys you?
- If you had intro music, what song would it be? Why?
- What were you really into when you were a kid?
- Where is the most beautiful place you have been?
- What word or saying from the past do you think should come back?

While these are not technical tasks, they represent the tasks you would have in a project.

#### Building Features

If you haven't already, clone your repo.

Now you will "build" each of the features for which you made tasks above. In this case, "building" a feature means adding a new Markdown (files ending in `.md`) document that answers the feature's question. No folder structure or other file convention is required--except that the files themselves should be Markdown files.

Check the [Git Workflow](./GIT-WORKFLOW.md) document for the template you need to follow for each feature.

There are many steps in the workflow, and they won't seem to provide meaningful value for such a trivial assignment as this. But they are _vital_ when working on real software.

When _all_ of the above features are complete, using the Git Workflow, move on to the next phase.

### Phase 2

This phase should be very quick, if you succeeded in completing the previous phase. The goal is to use the Git Workflow in _modifying_ a pre-existing feature, and to observe the similarities with creating brand new features.

You will be implementing two new "features":

1. List favorite entertainer's date of birth.
  - For this feature, don't add a new file. Just add the information to the document you made before about who your favorite entertainer is.
2. Remove least favorite question.
  - For this feature, remove an entire answer document from the project. (Just delete the file.)

Follow the same [Git Workflow](./GIT-WORKFLOW.md) document for these features--no deviations from it should be necessary.

That's all. This is enough practice for using Git next week in your pair project.
