#Who is your favorite entertainer (comedian, musician, actor, etc.)?

I have lots of favorite entertainers, so this is a hard one to anwer. I would say that my favorite musican (who is still alive today) is Howard Shore, noteable for his composition of film scores for the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies. Howard shore was born on October 18th, 1946 in Toronto, Canada.
