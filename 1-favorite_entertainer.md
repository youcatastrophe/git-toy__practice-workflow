#Who is your favorite entertainer (comedian, musician, actor, etc.)?

I have lots of favorite entertainers, so this is a hard one to anwer. I would say that my favorite musican (who is still alive today) is Howard Shore, noteable for his composition of film scores for the Lord of the Rings and Hobbit trilogies.
